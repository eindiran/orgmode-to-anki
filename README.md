# orgmode-to-anki

Convert a `.org` file into a format suitable for importing into Anki as a deck. The file is tab-separated, using partial HTML formatting to specify newlines and complex textual elements.

## Instructions

Run the `orgmode_to_anki.py` script over a `.org` file to produce a partially HTML formatted file suitable for use with Anki.

If your `.org` file is called `foo.org`, run the following command:

```./orgmode_to_anki.py -i foo.org -o foo.txt```

If you are on a non-POSIX operating system (e.g. Windows), run the command as:

```python3  orgmode_to_anki.py -i foo.org -o foo.txt```

This will produce a new file called `foo.txt`. You can then import the file into Anki using the standard import flow. Make sure that the field separating character is set to tab and that the "Allow HTML in fields" option is checked.

### Existing decks vs. new decks

The Anki interface allows you to either update an existing deck or to create a new deck during the import process. If you have previously created a deck and just want to add new cards, choose the update existing deck option. Otherwise, you will need to create a new deck and point to it while importing the text file generated by `orgmode-to-anki`.

### Flags

To find out more information about the available arguments, run:

```./orgmode_to_anki.py -h```

If you are on a non-POSIX operating system (e.g. Windows), run the command as:

```python3  orgmode_to_anki.py -h```

In addition to `-h` or `--help`, there are a number of other flags:

* `-i` or `--input` specifies the `.org` file to use as a source. *Required.*
* `-o` or `--output` specifies the location where the output file should be saved. A file type will not be added automatically if this option is specified. By default, the output file is the basename of the input file + `.txt`. *Optional.*
* `-a` or `--append` sets that the output file should not be overwritten, but instead should be appended to. Given that Anki ignores duplicated cards by default, it shouldn't often be necessary to do this. *Optional.*

### Encoding

This script only works with UTF-8 (or ASCII) encoded text. If you have a `.org` file that is encoded in another encoding, the script will complain and fail to complete running. Please convert it to UTF-8 using a tool like `iconv`.

For example, if you have a latin-1 encoded file:

```iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 foo.org -o foo_utf8.org```
